1. Asynchronous BFS Tree:

The program uses a separate input file to read the user data.

The first line of the file is the number of nodes in the graphs (n)
Second line contains the root node in the graph
'n' lines contains the node connection information between (i, j) indexes (1 - connection exists, 0 - no connection)
